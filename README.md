#  Stroke analysis and prediction in R
Academic project done with [@delgigio](https://github.com/delgigio). We simulated the interaction between a client (a medical reseacrh institute) and a data science team. The client tasked the team with some analysis regarding the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).

The notebooks include the questions proposed by the client, discussion and strategy definition by the DS team, and the actual implementation.
The analysis include statisctical techniques such as ANOVA and hypothesis testing, but also classification and regression tasks.
The main goal of this project was to showcase a data science pipeline, by exploiting useful R tools like workflows and its statistical ecosystem.
